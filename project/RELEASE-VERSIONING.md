# VIC Release Versioning

This document provides examples of VIC release versions.

The VIC project follows the general vX.Y.Z versioning scheme. Where X is Major, Y is
Minor and Z is Update. For releases that represent milestones there may be a
-milestone tag added. For example, v1.0.0-beta1 would represent the first beta
release of VIC.

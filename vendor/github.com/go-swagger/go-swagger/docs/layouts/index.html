        <h1>OpenAPIs 2.0</h1>
        <p>FKA swagger 2.0</p>
        <p>Swagger is a simple yet powerful representation of your RESTful API.</p>
        <p>With a Swagger-enabled API, you get interactive documentation, client SDK generation and discoverability. We created Swagger to help fulfill the promise of APIs.</p>
        <p>APIs form the connecting glue between modern applications. Nearly every application uses APIs to connect with corporate data sources, third party data services or other applications. Creating an open description format for API services that is vendor neutral, portable and open is critical to accelerating the vision of a truly connected world. </p>

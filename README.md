# vSphere Integrated Containers

VIC is a container runtime for vSphere, allowing developers familiar with Docker to develop in containers and deploy them alongside traditional VM-based workloads on vSphere clusters, and allowing for these workloads to be managed through the vSphere UI in a way familiar to existing vSphere admins.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on submitting changes and the contribution workflow.

## Building

Building the project is done with a combination of make and containers, with golang:1.6 being the common container base. This is done so that it's possible to build directly, without a functional docker, if using a Debian based system with the Go 1.6 toolchain and Drone.io installed.

To build as closely as possible to the formal build:
```
drone exec -trusted -cache
```

To build without modifying the local system:
```
docker run -v $(pwd):/go/src/github.com/vmware/vic -w /go/src/github.com/vmware/vic golang:1.6 make all
```

To build directly:
```
make all
```

There are three primary components generated by a full build, found in `$BIN` (the ./bin directory by default). The make targets used are the following:
1. install.sh - make install
2. appliance.iso - make appliance
3. bootstrap.iso - make bootstrap

## Installing

Once built, the result can be installed with the following command. This is just an example - see the install help output for all options:
```
install.sh -t 'user:password@my-esx-fqdn' -g target-cert-name -i datastore1 -p /ha-datacenter/host/my-esx-fqdn vch-name
```

## Building binaries for development

The project utilizes [git-hooks](https://github.com/icefox/git-hooks), so please install and ensure it is referenced in your PATH.

Some of the project binaries can only be built on Linux.  If you are developing on a Mac or Windows OS, then the easiest way to facilitate a build is by utilizing the project's Vagrantfile.  The Vagrantfile will share the directory where the file is executed and set the GOPATH based on that share.

To build the component binaries, ensure `GOPATH` is set, then issue the following command in the root directory:
```
$ make components
```
This will install required tools and build the component binaries `tether-windows`, `tether-linux`, `rpctool` and server binaries `docker-engine-server`, `port-layer-server`.  The binaries will be created in the `$BIN` directory, ./bin by default.

To run tests after a successfull build, issue the following:
```
$ make test
```

## Managing vendor/ directory

To build the VIC dependencies, ensure `GOPATH` is set, then issue the following.
``
$ make gvt vendor
``

This will install the [gvt](https://github.com/FiloSottile/gvt) utility and retrieve the build dependencies via `gvt restore`

## Building the ISOs

The component binaries above are packaged into ISO files, appliance.iso and bootstrap.iso, that are used by the installer. The generation of the ISOs is split into the following targets:
iso-base, appliance-staging, bootstrap-staging, appliance, and bootstrap. Generation of the ISOs involves authoring a new root filesystem, meaning running a package manager (currently yum) and packing/unpacking archives. To install packages and preserve file permissions while unpacking these steps should be run as root, whether directly or in a container. To generate the ISOs:
```
# make isos
```

The appliance and bootstrap ISOs are bootable CD images used to start the VMs that make up VIC. To build the image using [docker](https://www.docker.com/), ensure `GOPATH` is set and `docker` is installed, then issue the following.
```
docker run -v $(pwd):/go/src/github.com/vmware/vic -w /go/src/github.com/vmware/vic golang:1.6 make isos
```

Alternatively, the iso image can be built locally.  Again, ensure `GOPATH` is set, but also ensure the following packages are installed. This will attempt to install the following packages if not present using apt-get:
```
	curl \
	cpio \
	tar \
	xorriso \
	rpm \
	ca-certificates \
	yum
```

Package names may vary depending on the distribution being used.  Once installed, issue the following (the targets listed here are those executed when using the `iso` target.

```
make iso-base appliance-staging appliance bootstrap-staging bootstrap
```

The iso image will be created in `$BIN`

## Building with CI

Merges to this repository will trigger builds with [Drone][dronevic].

To build locally with Drone:

Ensure that you have Docker 1.6 or higher installed.
Install the Drone command line tools.
From the root directory of the `vic` repository run `drone exec -trusted -cache -e VIC_ESX_TEST_URL=""`

## Starting docker-engine-server

Generate certificate pair

```
go run `go env GOROOT`/src/crypto/tls/generate_cert.go --host localhost
```

Start docker-engine-server

```
binary/docker-engine-server --port=2376 --tls-certificate=cert.pem --tls-key=key.pem
```

## Starting port-layer-server

```
binary/port-layer-server --port 8080 --path /tmp/
```

## Testing with docker client

Download docker client
```
https://get.docker.com/builds/Linux/x86_64/docker-1.10.2
https://get.docker.com/builds/Darwin/x86_64/docker-1.10.2
https://get.docker.com/builds/Windows/x86_64/docker-1.10.2.exe
```

Pull an image
```
$ DOCKER_HOST=tcp://127.0.0.1:2376 docker pull tomcat
```
